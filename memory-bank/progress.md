## Project Status Overview

The Market Sidekick project is in active development with the core Market Dashboard feature completed. The current focus is on implementing the Watchlist screen, followed by the Stock Detail view and Reflection Tool.

## What Works

### Implemented Features

1. **Core Application Structure**
   - Next.js 15 project with TypeScript set up
   - Tailwind CSS configured
   - shadcn/ui components installed and working
   - ESLint and Prettier configured
   - Directory structure established

2. **Layout and Navigation**
   - Main application layout implemented
   - Header with navigation links
   - Footer with important information
   - Theme toggling functionality

3. **Market Dashboard (Home Screen)**
   - Dashboard layout with responsive grid
   - Market price display for major indices
   - Key market indicators with status badges

- `MarketPriceCard` (`components/dashboard/market-price-card.tsx`)
- `ChartComponent` (`components/dashboard/chart-component.tsx`)
- `Header` (`components/header.tsx`)
- `Footer` (`components/footer.tsx`)
- `Navigation` (`components/main-nav.tsx`)
- `ThemeProvider` (`components/theme-provider.tsx`)
- `ThemeToggle` (`components/theme-toggle.tsx`)

## What's Left to Build

### Features In Progress

1. **Watchlist Screen**
   - Planned but not started
   - Will require Table component implementation
   - Need to create form for adding stocks
   - Local storage integration for persistence

### Features Not Started

1. **Stock Detail View**
   - Individual stock pages with comprehensive metrics
   - Price history visualization
   - AI analysis integration
   - Buy/sell reflection buttons

2. **Reflection Tool**
   - Guided reflection forms for investment decisions
   - Decision reasoning capture
   - Historical decision storage

3. **Settings Page**
   - Theme customization
   - Notification preferences
   - API key management
   - Display preferences

### API Integrations

1. **Financial Data APIs**
   - Market data integration
   - Stock price fetching
   - Historical data for charts

2. **AI Integration**
   - Vercel AI SDK implementation
   - Dynamic explanation generation

### shadcn/ui Components Needed

The following shadcn/ui components still need to be installed:
- Table
- Dialog
- Form
- Input (outside of shadcn defaults)
- Select
- Switch
- Alert

## Known Issues

1. **Mock Data Limitations**
   - All data is currently static/mock data
   - No real-time updates or historical data
   - Chart components are placeholders without real visualization

2. **Incomplete Features**
   - Navigation links to unimplemented pages
   - Chart components lack real data visualization
   - No state persistence between sessions

3. **Technical Debt**
   - Need proper type definitions for all data structures
   - Missing error handling for future API calls
   - Placeholder components need proper implementation
