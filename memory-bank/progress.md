# Market Sidekick - Progress Tracking

## Project Status Overview

The Market Sidekick project is in active development with the core Market Dashboard feature completed. The development focus is now transitioning to the Watchlist screen implementation, which will utilize the recently created StockTable component. This will be followed by the Stock Detail view and Reflection Tool implementations.

## What Works

### Implemented Features

1. **Core Application Structure**
   - Next.js 15 project with TypeScript set up
   - Tailwind CSS configured
   - shadcn/ui components installed and working
   - ESLint and Prettier configured
   - Directory structure established

2. **Layout and Navigation**
   - Main application layout implemented
   - Header with navigation links
   - Footer with important information
   - Theme toggling functionality (Dark theme now uses navy/gradient style)

3. **Market Dashboard (Home Screen)**
   - Dashboard layout with responsive grid
   - Market price display for major indices
   - Key market indicators with status badges
   - AI-powered explanations for indicators (accessible via "Ask AI" sheet)
   - Top Watchlist table using the reusable `StockTable` component (with mock data)
   - Complete mobile and desktop responsiveness
   - Interactive indicator cards with hover effects and dialog popups for detailed information

### Installed shadcn/ui Components

The following shadcn/ui components have been successfully installed and integrated:
- Card
- Badge
- Separator
- Tabs
- ScrollArea
- Button
- Dropdown Menu
- Avatar
- Textarea
- Table
- Sheet
- Dialog

### Functional Components

The following custom components have been implemented and are working correctly:
- `DashboardHeader` (`components/dashboard/header.tsx`)
- `IndicatorCard` (`components/dashboard/indicator-card.tsx`)
  - Restructured UI: Header with Title/Description (left) and Badge/Ask AI button (right)
  - Card-level enhancements: hover effects with elevation, shadows, and border highlighting
  - Dialog integration with title area as trigger
  - Event propagation management: "Ask AI" button click doesn't trigger dialog
  - State management: tracks hover state using React useState
  - Interactive cursor feedback on hover
  - Tooltips on sparkline showing date/value on hover
- `TopIndicatorCard` (`components/dashboard/top-indicator-card.tsx`)
  - Compact variation of indicator card
  - Horizontal layout with title and sparkline on left, value/badge on right
  - Responsive design with appropriate spacing
- `MarketPriceCard` (`components/dashboard/market-price-card.tsx`)
- `ChartComponent` (`components/dashboard/chart-component.tsx`) - Placeholder
- `StockTable` (`components/dashboard/stock-table.tsx`) - Reusable table for displaying stock data
- `Header` (`components/header.tsx`)
- `Footer` (`components/footer.tsx`) - Text centering corrected
- `Navigation` (`components/main-nav.tsx`)
- `ThemeProvider` (`components/theme-provider.tsx`)
- `ThemeToggle` (`components/theme-toggle.tsx`)

### Installed Libraries
- `recharts` - Successfully integrated for sparklines in indicator cards

## What's Left to Build

### Features In Progress

1. **Indicator Card Dialog Enhancement**
   - Need to make dialog content dynamic based on the specific indicator
   - Need to create proper detailed views for each indicator type
   - Currently shows static "Hello World" content 

2. **Watchlist Screen**
   - Planned but not started
   - Will utilize existing StockTable component
   - Need to create form for adding stocks
   - Local storage integration for persistence

### Features Not Started

1. **Stock Detail View**
   - Individual stock pages with comprehensive metrics
   - Price history visualization
   - AI analysis integration
   - Buy/sell reflection buttons

2. **Reflection Tool**
   - Guided reflection forms for investment decisions
   - Decision reasoning capture
   - Historical decision storage

3. **Settings Page**
   - Theme customization
   - Notification preferences
   - API key management
   - Display preferences

### API Integrations

1. **Financial Data APIs**
   - Market data integration
   - Stock price fetching
   - Historical data for charts

2. **AI Integration**
   - Vercel AI SDK implementation
   - Dynamic explanation generation
   - Market analysis capabilities

### shadcn/ui Components Needed

The following shadcn/ui components still need to be installed:
- Form
- Input (outside of shadcn defaults)
- Select
- Switch
- Alert

## Known Issues

1. **Mock Data Limitations**
   - All data is currently static/mock data (including the Top Watchlist)
   - No real-time updates or historical data
   - Chart components (other than sparklines) are still placeholders if used elsewhere

2. **Component-Specific Issues**
   - **StockTable Legend Issue:** Persistent JSX escaping errors reported in the `StockTable` component's legend, potentially affecting rendering or causing dev environment warnings
   - **Indicator Dialog Content:** The dialog triggered by clicking indicator cards currently shows static content ("Hello World") and needs to be made dynamic

3. **Incomplete Features**
   - Navigation links to unimplemented pages
   - Top Watchlist on dashboard uses mock data and isn't linked to actual watchlist functionality
   - No state persistence between sessions (including watchlist)

4. **Technical Debt**
   - Need proper type definitions for all data structures
   - Missing error handling for future API calls
   - Placeholder components need proper implementation
