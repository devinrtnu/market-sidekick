# Market Sidekick - Progress Tracking

## Project Status Overview

The Market Sidekick project is in active development with the core Market Dashboard feature completed. The current focus is on implementing the Watchlist screen, followed by the Stock Detail view and Reflection Tool.

## What Works

### Implemented Features

1. **Core Application Structure**
   - Next.js 15 project with TypeScript set up
   - Tailwind CSS configured
   - shadcn/ui components installed and working
   - ESLint and Prettier configured
   - Directory structure established

2. **Layout and Navigation**
   - Main application layout implemented
   - Header with navigation links
   - Footer with important information
   - Theme toggling functionality (Dark theme now uses navy/gradient style)

3. **Market Dashboard (Home Screen)**
   - Dashboard layout with responsive grid
   - Market price display for major indices
   - Key market indicators with status badges
   - AI-powered explanations for indicators (now accessible via "Ask AI" sheet)
   - **Top Watchlist table using the reusable `StockTable` component (with mock data)** replacing the previous Market Trends charts
   - Complete mobile and desktop responsiveness
   - Redundant title/description removed from Top Watchlist table

### Installed shadcn/ui Components

The following shadcn/ui components have been successfully installed and integrated:
- Card
- Badge
- Separator
- Tabs
- ScrollArea
- Button
- Dropdown Menu
- Avatar
- Textarea
- Table
- Sheet

### Functional Components

The following custom components have been implemented and are working correctly:
- `DashboardHeader` (`components/dashboard/header.tsx`)
- `IndicatorCard` (`components/dashboard/indicator-card.tsx`) - Restructured UI based on example: Header now contains Title/Description (left) and Badge/Ask AI button (right). Content shows Value/Change and Sparkline. Footer removed. Uses `Sheet` for "Ask AI" and `recharts` for sparkline with interactive tooltip showing date/value.
- `MarketPriceCard` (`components/dashboard/market-price-card.tsx`)
- `ChartComponent` (`components/dashboard/chart-component.tsx`) - Placeholder, sparklines implemented in IndicatorCard.
- `Header` (`components/header.tsx`)
- `Footer` (`components/footer.tsx`)
- `Navigation` (`components/main-nav.tsx`)
- `ThemeProvider` (`components/theme-provider.tsx`)
- `ThemeToggle` (`components/theme-toggle.tsx`)
- `StockTable` (`components/dashboard/stock-table.tsx`) - Reusable table for displaying stock data.
- `Footer` (`components/footer.tsx`) - Text centering corrected.
- **Libraries:** `recharts` installed and used for sparklines.

## What's Left to Build

### Features In Progress

1. **Watchlist Screen**
   - Planned but not started
   - Will require Table component implementation
   - Need to create form for adding stocks
   - Local storage integration for persistence

### Features Not Started

1. **Stock Detail View**
   - Individual stock pages with comprehensive metrics
   - Price history visualization
   - AI analysis integration
   - Buy/sell reflection buttons

2. **Reflection Tool**
   - Guided reflection forms for investment decisions
   - Decision reasoning capture
   - Historical decision storage

3. **Settings Page**
   - Theme customization
   - Notification preferences
   - API key management
   - Display preferences

### API Integrations

1. **Financial Data APIs**
   - Market data integration
   - Stock price fetching
   - Historical data for charts

2. **AI Integration**
   - Vercel AI SDK implementation
   - Dynamic explanation generation
   - Market analysis capabilities

### shadcn/ui Components Needed

The following shadcn/ui components still need to be installed:
- Dialog
- Form
- Input (outside of shadcn defaults)
- Select
- Switch
- Alert

## Known Issues

1. **Mock Data Limitations**
   - All data is currently static/mock data (including the new Top Watchlist)
   - No real-time updates or historical data (including sparklines)
   - Chart components (other than sparklines) are still placeholders if used elsewhere
   - **StockTable Legend Issue:** Persistent JSX escaping errors reported in the `StockTable` component's legend, potentially affecting rendering or causing dev environment warnings.
   - **Theme:** Dark theme updated to navy/gradient style. Base `Card` component modified for gradient background in dark mode.

2. **Incomplete Features**
   - Navigation links to unimplemented pages
   - Top Watchlist on dashboard uses mock data and isn't linked to actual watchlist functionality
   - No state persistence between sessions (including watchlist)

3. **Technical Debt**
   - Need proper type definitions for all data structures
   - Missing error handling for future API calls
   - Placeholder components need proper implementation
